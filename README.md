# OpenServ Whale Watcher
AI-powered blockchain analytics tool that tracks, analyzes, and predicts whale wallet activity in real-time.

## Overview
The **Whale Watcher & Mimic Agent** is an AI-driven blockchain intelligence tool that:
- **Monitors whale wallets** 
- **Extracts and analyzes transaction data** 
- **Predicts whale movements and market trends** 
- **Generates detailed reports for traders and analysts** 

## Motivation
Tracking whale wallets is critical in the crypto market. Their large transactions often influence prices and market trends. This project was built for the **OpenServ Hackathon** to automate blockchain monitoring and predictive analysis using AI.

## Problem It Solves
✅ **Retail traders lack access to whale transaction insights**  
✅ **Large transactions can manipulate prices, causing unexpected market movements**  
✅ **AI-based analytics can help small traders follow whale strategies**  

## Features
- **Real-time monitoring** of whale transactions
- **Transaction type tracking** (Normal, Internal, ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)
- **AI-powered analysis** using Google's Gemini AI
- **Predictive modeling** for future market trends
- **Automated reporting** for easy decision-making

## How It Works
1. **Whale Watcher Fetcher** (Tracks transactions & sends data)
2. **AI Analyzer & Predictor** (Analyzes and predicts trends using AI)
3. **User Report Generation** (Provides insights for better trading decisions)

## What We Learned
- **Blockchain analytics is powerful but underutilized.**
- **AI can reveal hidden trading patterns.**
- **Whale movements provide early signals for market shifts.**

## Why This Project Stands Out
✅ **Real-time AI analysis of whale transactions**  
✅ **Predictive modeling to forecast market behavior**  
✅ **Seamless integration with OpenServ AI Agents**
